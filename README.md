## üîß How It Works

This container uses a **simple scheduler script** instead of cron for maximum reliability and visibility.

### Backup Strategy

**Important:** The container backs up the **contents** of the mounted directory, not the directory itself. This ensures that when you restore:
- If you have `/backup/a`, `/backup/b`, `/backup/c`
- They restore as `/backup/a`, `/backup/b`, `/backup/c`
- **Not** as `/backup/backup/a`, `/backup/backup/b`, `/backup/backup/c`

### Startup Behavior

1. **On Container Start:**
   - Checks if backup directory is empty ‚Üí restores latest snapshot if needed
   - Optionally runs initial backup (controlled by `RUN_BACKUP_ON_STARTUP`)
   - Starts scheduler loop

2. **During Operation:**
   - Checks every 60 seconds if current time matches schedule
   - Runs backup if schedule matches
   - Runs restore check if schedule matches (only if directory is empty)
   - Applies retention policy after each successful backup

3. **Retention Management:**
   - Automatically cleans up old snapshots after each backup
   - Groups snapshots by **paths** (not hostname) for consistent cleanup across container restarts
   - Respects configured retention policy (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)

4. **Health Monitoring:**
   - Detects backup/restore failures within 60 seconds
   - Marks container UNHEALTHY automatically
   - Enables automatic restart with autoheal

### Why No Cron?

- ‚úÖ **Simpler** - No crontab configuration
- ‚úÖ **More reliable** - No permission issues
- ‚úÖ **Better visibility** - All logs in stdout
- ‚úÖ **Easier debugging** - See exactly what's happening
- ‚úÖ **Same flexibility** - Supports cron syntax

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Prepare Your Environment

```bash
# Create a directory for your data to backup
mkdir -p /path/to/your/data

# Clone the repository (optional - can build directly from GitHub)
git clone https://github.com/dynacylabs/docker-b2-backup.git
cd docker-b2-backup
```

### 2. Create Configuration File

Create a `.env` file or `b2-backup.env` with your settings:

```bash
# Required: Backblaze B2 Configuration
RESTIC_REPOSITORY=b2:your-bucket-name:backup-path
RESTIC_PASSWORD=your-secure-restic-password
B2_ACCOUNT_ID=your-b2-account-id
B2_ACCOUNT_KEY=your-b2-application-key

# Required: Backup Source
BACKUP_SOURCE_DIR=/backup

# Optional: Customize schedules (cron format)
BACKUP_SCHEDULE=0 0 * * *              # Daily at midnight
RESTORE_CHECK_SCHEDULE=0 0 * * *       # Daily at midnight
RUN_BACKUP_ON_STARTUP=false            # Don't backup on container start

# Optional: Retention Policy
RESTIC_KEEP_DAILY=7
RESTIC_KEEP_WEEKLY=4
RESTIC_KEEP_MONTHLY=6
RESTIC_KEEP_YEARLY=2
```

### 3. Create Docker Compose File

```yaml
services:
  b2-backup:
    build:
      context: https://github.com/dynacylabs/docker-b2-backup.git
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: b2-backup
    volumes:
      - /path/to/your/data:/backup
    env_file:
      - ./b2-backup.env
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "/src/healthcheck.sh"]
      interval: 60s
      timeout: 60s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 60s
```

### 4. Deploy

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 5. Monitor

```bash
# Check container status and health
docker compose ps

# View logs in real-time
docker compose logs -f b2-backup

# View snapshots in repository
docker exec b2-backup restic snapshots

# Check last backup status
docker exec b2-backup cat /tmp/last_backup_success
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `RESTIC_REPOSITORY` | Backblaze B2 repository path | `b2:my-bucket:backups/server1` |
| `RESTIC_PASSWORD` | Encryption password for backups | `your-secure-password` |
| `B2_ACCOUNT_ID` | Backblaze B2 account ID | `005fb80d1ad8fa50000000002` |
| `B2_ACCOUNT_KEY` | Backblaze B2 application key | `K005xJm6AX6NmZgZHKWExjGq25XUftA` |

### Optional Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `BACKUP_SOURCE_DIR` | `/backup` | Directory to backup (contents, not directory itself) |
| `BACKUP_TEMP_DIR` | `/tmp/backup` | Temporary staging directory (legacy, not used in current version) |
| `BACKUP_SCHEDULE` | `0 2 * * *` | Schedule for backups (cron syntax) |
| `RESTORE_CHECK_SCHEDULE` | `0 1 * * *` | Schedule for restore checks (cron syntax) |
| `RUN_BACKUP_ON_STARTUP` | `true` | Run backup when container starts |
| `RESTIC_KEEP_DAILY` | `7` | Daily snapshots to retain |
| `RESTIC_KEEP_WEEKLY` | `4` | Weekly snapshots to retain |
| `RESTIC_KEEP_MONTHLY` | `6` | Monthly snapshots to retain |
| `RESTIC_KEEP_YEARLY` | `2` | Yearly snapshots to retain |

| `PUID` | `1000` | User ID for file ownership (optional) |
| `PGID` | `1000` | Group ID for file ownership (optional) |

### Cron Schedule Examples

The scheduler uses familiar cron-like syntax:

```bash
# Format: minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week

# Daily at midnight
BACKUP_SCHEDULE="0 0 * * *"

# Daily at 2:30 AM
BACKUP_SCHEDULE="30 2 * * *"

# Every 6 hours
BACKUP_SCHEDULE="0 */6 * * *"

# Twice daily (midnight and noon)
BACKUP_SCHEDULE="0 0,12 * * *"

# Weekly on Sunday at 2 AM
BACKUP_SCHEDULE="0 2 * * 0"

# Monthly on the 1st at 3 AM
BACKUP_SCHEDULE="0 3 1 * *"

# Every 15 minutes (for testing)
BACKUP_SCHEDULE="*/15 * * * *"
```

**Format:** `minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`
- Use `*` for "any value"
- Use `*/n` for "every n units"
- Use `1-5` for ranges
- Use `1,3,5` for lists
- Day of week: 0-7 (0 and 7 are Sunday)

## üìÅ Volume Mounting

The container backs up the **contents** of your mounted directory, not the directory itself.

```yaml
services:
  b2-backup:
    volumes:
      - /path/to/your/data:/backup     # Your data to backup
```

**Important:**
- Mount your data directory to `/backup` (or configure `BACKUP_SOURCE_DIR`)
- The backup will store the contents directly (no nested `/backup/backup/` structure)
- On restore, files are placed directly in the mount point

**Example:**
If your host has `/home/user/mydata` containing `file1.txt` and `folder1/`:
```yaml
volumes:
  - /home/user/mydata:/backup
```

The backup will contain:
- `file1.txt`
- `folder1/`

On restore, they appear at:
- `/home/user/mydata/file1.txt`
- `/home/user/mydata/folder1/`

**Not** at `/home/user/mydata/backup/file1.txt` ‚úÖ

## üë§ User Permission Management

The container runs as the `backup` user (UID 1000, GID 1000 by default). Files in your backup directory should be readable by this user.

### Quick Setup (Most Common)

```bash
# Make your data readable by the backup user
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /path/to/your/data

# Or make it world-readable (less secure)
sudo chmod -R 755 /path/to/your/data
```

### Custom User ID

If you need different permissions, set `PUID` and `PGID`:

```bash
# In your .env file
PUID=1003  # Your user ID (from: id -u)
PGID=1003  # Your group ID (from: id -g)
```

Then in your docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
services:
  b2-backup:
    user: "${PUID}:${PGID}"  # Or directly: user: "1003:1003"
```

## üè• Health Monitoring

The container includes comprehensive health monitoring that automatically detects failures and marks the container as UNHEALTHY.

### What Gets Monitored

| Check | Frequency | Action on Failure |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Scheduler process running | Every 60s | UNHEALTHY |
| Backup status markers | Every 60s | UNHEALTHY |
| Restore status markers | Every 60s | UNHEALTHY |
| Recent log errors | Every 60s | UNHEALTHY |
| Environment variables | Every 60s | UNHEALTHY |
| Required scripts | Every 60s | UNHEALTHY |
| Last successful backup | Every 60s | WARNING (48h+) |
| Disk space | Every 60s | WARNING (85%+) |
| B2 connectivity | Every 1 hour | UNHEALTHY |
| Repository integrity | Every 1 hour | WARNING |

### Quick Health Check

```bash
# Check container health status
docker ps

# View detailed health output
docker inspect b2-backup --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}'

# Run manual health check
docker exec b2-backup /src/healthcheck.sh

# View last health check output
docker inspect b2-backup --format='{{range .State.Health.Log}}{{.Output}}{{end}}' | tail -1
```

### Understanding Health Status

**HEALTHY:**
```
2025-10-23 15:30:00 - HEALTHY: Basic check passed (next full B2 check in 3540s)
```

**UNHEALTHY:**
```
2025-10-23 15:30:00 - UNHEALTHY: Backup failed 2h ago - Reason: Network timeout
```

### Status Files

The container uses status files to track operations:

```bash
/tmp/backup_status           # Written on backup failure
/tmp/last_backup_success     # Timestamp of last successful backup
/tmp/restore_status          # Written on restore failure  
/tmp/last_restore_success    # Timestamp of last successful restore
```

### Auto-Recovery with Autoheal

Combine with [autoheal](https://github.com/willfarrell/docker-autoheal) to automatically restart unhealthy containers:

```yaml
services:
  autoheal:
    image: willfarrell/autoheal
    environment:
      - AUTOHEAL_CONTAINER_LABEL=all
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    restart: unless-stopped

  b2-backup:
    # ... your backup config
    labels:
      autoheal: true  # Optional: explicit label
```

When the backup container goes UNHEALTHY, autoheal restarts it automatically.

## üîÑ Backup and Restore Operations

### Automatic Operations

The container handles most operations automatically:

- **Backup**: Runs on configured schedule (and optionally on startup)
- **Restore**: Automatically restores if backup directory is empty
- **Retention Cleanup**: Removes old snapshots after each backup
- **Health Checks**: Continuous monitoring every 60 seconds

### Manual Backup

```bash
# Run backup manually
docker exec b2-backup /src/backup.sh

# The script will:
# - Change to /backup directory
# - Backup current directory contents (.)
# - Apply retention policy (cleanup old snapshots)
# - Group snapshots by paths (not hostname)
```

### Manual Restore

```bash
# Restore latest snapshot
docker exec b2-backup /src/restore.sh

# Or restore specific snapshot
docker exec b2-backup restic restore <snapshot-id> --target /backup
```

### Snapshot Management

```bash
# List all snapshots
docker exec b2-backup restic snapshots

# View snapshot details
docker exec b2-backup restic snapshots --compact

# Repository statistics
docker exec b2-backup restic stats

# Check repository integrity
docker exec b2-backup restic check

# Check 10% of repository data
docker exec b2-backup restic check --read-data-subset=10%
```

### Manual Cleanup

```bash
# Clean up snapshots (already runs automatically after backup)
docker exec b2-backup restic forget \
  --group-by paths \
  --keep-daily 7 \
  --keep-weekly 4 \
  --keep-monthly 6 \
  --keep-yearly 2 \
  --prune

# Dry run (see what would be deleted)
docker exec b2-backup restic forget \
  --group-by paths \
  --keep-daily 7 \
  --keep-weekly 4 \
  --keep-monthly 6 \
  --keep-yearly 2 \
  --dry-run
```

### Migration from Old Backup Format

If you're upgrading from a version that created nested `/backup/backup/` directories:

```bash
# Run the fix script
docker exec b2-backup /src/fix_nested_backup.sh

# This will:
# - Detect nested backup directory
# - Move contents up one level
# - Run a fresh backup with correct structure
```

## üìä Retention Policy

The retention policy controls how many snapshots are kept. Old snapshots are automatically deleted after each successful backup.

### Default Policy

- **7 daily** snapshots (last week)
- **4 weekly** snapshots (last ~month)
- **6 monthly** snapshots (last 6 months)  
- **2 yearly** snapshots (last 2 years)

**Approximate total**: ~19 snapshots maximum

### How Retention Works

1. **After each backup**, the cleanup process runs automatically
2. Snapshots are **grouped by paths** (not by hostname)
3. This means retention works correctly even if you:
   - Restart the container multiple times
   - Change the container hostname
   - Rebuild with a new container ID

**Example:** If you restart your container 10 times in one day, you'll still only keep 7 daily snapshots total (not 70).

### Customizing Retention

Adjust the values in your env file:

```bash
# Keep more history
RESTIC_KEEP_DAILY=14       # 2 weeks of daily backups
RESTIC_KEEP_WEEKLY=8       # 2 months of weekly backups
RESTIC_KEEP_MONTHLY=12     # 1 year of monthly backups
RESTIC_KEEP_YEARLY=5       # 5 years of yearly backups

# Keep less (save storage costs)
RESTIC_KEEP_DAILY=3        # Only 3 days
RESTIC_KEEP_WEEKLY=2       # Only 2 weeks
RESTIC_KEEP_MONTHLY=3      # Only 3 months
RESTIC_KEEP_YEARLY=1       # Only 1 year
```

### Important Notes

- Retention is enforced **after every successful backup**
- Uses `--group-by paths` to avoid per-hostname retention groups
- Snapshots are permanently deleted with `--prune` flag
- Failed cleanup doesn't fail the backup (warning only)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Multiple Snapshots on Same Day

**Symptom:** You see multiple snapshots with the same date in `restic snapshots`

**Cause:** The container runs a backup on startup by default (`RUN_BACKUP_ON_STARTUP=true`)

**Solution:** 
```bash
# Disable startup backup
echo "RUN_BACKUP_ON_STARTUP=false" >> b2-backup.env

# Rebuild container
docker compose up -d --force-recreate b2-backup
```

The retention policy will clean up excess snapshots on the next scheduled backup.

---

#### Too Many Snapshots (Retention Not Working)

**Symptom:** You have dozens of snapshots instead of ~19

**Cause:** Old version didn't use `--group-by paths`, so each container restart created a new retention group

**Solution:**
```bash
# Manual cleanup with correct grouping
docker exec b2-backup restic forget \
  --group-by paths \
  --keep-daily 7 \
  --keep-weekly 4 \
  --keep-monthly 6 \
  --keep-yearly 2 \
  --prune

# Update container to latest version
docker compose pull b2-backup  # Or rebuild from GitHub
docker compose up -d b2-backup
```

---

#### Nested Backup Directory (old issue)

**Symptom:** Files restore to `/backup/backup/` instead of `/backup/`

**Cause:** Using old backup format that backed up the directory instead of its contents

**Solution:**
```bash
# Run the migration script
docker exec b2-backup /src/fix_nested_backup.sh

# Or manually:
docker exec b2-backup bash -c "mv /backup/backup/* /backup/ && rmdir /backup/backup"
docker exec b2-backup /src/backup.sh  # Create new backup with correct structure
```

---

#### Permission Denied Errors

**Symptom:** Backup fails with "permission denied" errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Option 1: Fix ownership
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /path/to/your/data

# Option 2: Make readable
sudo chmod -R 755 /path/to/your/data

# Option 3: Use your own UID/GID
# In docker-compose.yml:
user: "$(id -u):$(id -g)"
```

---

#### B2 Authentication Errors

**Symptom:** Errors about authentication, 401, or 403

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify credentials in env file
docker exec b2-backup env | grep B2_

# Check B2 account:
# 1. Login to Backblaze B2 console
# 2. Verify application key hasn't expired
# 3. Check key has proper permissions (read/write)
# 4. Verify bucket exists

# Test B2 connectivity
docker exec b2-backup restic snapshots
```

---

#### Container Marked UNHEALTHY

**Symptom:** `docker ps` shows container as "unhealthy"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check why unhealthy
docker inspect b2-backup --format='{{range .State.Health.Log}}{{.Output}}{{end}}' | tail -1

# View detailed status
docker exec b2-backup /src/healthcheck.sh

# Check for failure markers
docker exec b2-backup cat /tmp/backup_status
docker exec b2-backup cat /tmp/restore_status

# Clear failure status and let it retry
docker exec b2-backup rm -f /tmp/backup_status /tmp/restore_status

# Or restart container
docker compose restart b2-backup
```

---

#### Scheduler Not Running Backups

**Symptom:** No backups at scheduled time

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check scheduler is running
docker exec b2-backup ps aux | grep scheduler

# Verify schedule format
docker exec b2-backup env | grep SCHEDULE

# Check container time
docker exec b2-backup date

# Test with frequent schedule (every 2 minutes)
# In b2-backup.env:
BACKUP_SCHEDULE=*/2 * * * *

# Watch logs
docker logs -f b2-backup
```

---

### Debug Commands

```bash
# View all logs
docker logs b2-backup --tail 100

# Interactive shell

```

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check this troubleshooting section
2. Enable debug logging: `docker logs -f b2-backup`
3. Run manual health check: `docker exec b2-backup /src/healthcheck.sh`
4. Check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dynacylabs/docker-b2-backup/issues)
5. Open a new issue with:
   - Container logs
   - Health check output
   - Your docker-compose.yml (redact credentials)
   - Steps to reproduce

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Test Your Backups Regularly**
   ```bash
   # Restore to a test directory periodically
   docker exec b2-backup restic restore latest --target /tmp/restore-test
   ```

2. **Monitor Health Status**
   ```bash
   # Set up monitoring alerts for unhealthy containers
   docker ps --filter "health=unhealthy"
   ```

3. **Secure Your Credentials**
   - Use application keys with minimal B2 permissions (read/write to specific bucket)
   - Store `.env` files securely (never commit to git)
   - Rotate B2 keys periodically

4. **Optimize Retention Policy**
   - Balance recovery needs vs. storage costs
   - Daily backups are for recent recovery (7 days)
   - Weekly/monthly for longer-term recovery
   - Yearly for compliance/archival

5. **Configure Startup Backup**
   - Set `RUN_BACKUP_ON_STARTUP=false` for production (avoids duplicate backups)
   - Keep `true` for testing or critical systems

6. **Schedule Wisely**
   - Run backups during low-activity periods
   - Avoid overlapping backup and restore schedules
   - Common: `BACKUP_SCHEDULE=0 0 * * *` (midnight daily)

7. **Monitor Disk Space**
   - The healthcheck warns at 85% disk usage
   - Monitor backup source directory size
   - Prune old files before they're backed up

8. **Understand Retention Grouping**
   - Retention is by **paths**, not hostname
   - Container restarts don't create separate retention groups
   - All snapshots are treated as one logical backup set

9. **Use Autoheal for Recovery**
   ```yaml
   # Add to docker-compose.yml
   autoheal:
     image: willfarrell/autoheal
     volumes:
       - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
     restart: unless-stopped
   ```

10. **Keep Container Updated**
    ```bash
    # Pull latest changes
    docker compose pull b2-backup
    # Or rebuild from GitHub
    docker compose up -d --build b2-backup
    ```
